The reception is approaching! With your help, Alfred is now nearly finished with the preparations.

But now there's a problem: the Batmobile has disappeared. Alfred needs to find a replacement, and find it quickly.

Fortunately, a few biopics have been done on Bruce Wayne's life, so maybe Alfred could get a car left behind on one of the movie set, and re-engineer it up to modern standards, which certainly would include a full self-driving option.

But this could be anywhere in the filming locations around the world - which could be numerous.

So Alfred wants your help. Could you build an agent able to solve this task?

    ðŸ‘‰ Find all Batman filming locations in the world, calculate the time to transfer via boat to there, and represent them on a map, with a color varying by boat transfer time. Also represent some supercar factories with the same boat transfer time.

Let's build this!
